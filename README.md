# Machine-Learning-Project-1
It consist of two different tasks provided by the supervisor in which, I am suppose to fuse 3 classifiers ((1) Decision Tree, (2) Gaussian NaÃ¯ve Bayes, and (3) Logistic Regression) using Majority Voting Rule, and perform different tasks with it.
Three futher tasks are:
1)Comparing the accuracies of the fused model with AdaBoost Ensemble with Decision Tree as the base learner. Then training the classifiers using the first 1000 instances and use the remaining 3601 for testing.  
2)Comparing the accuracies of the fused model with Random Forest (with 1000 base learners). Then training the classifiers using the first 1000 instances and use the remaining 3601 for testing. 
3)Studing the impact of training sample size on the accuracies of the fused classifier and the AdaBoost Ensemble with Decision Tree as the base learner. And then comparing their accuracies with the following training-test splits: 50%-50%, 60%-40%, 70%-30%, and 80%-20%.

=>At last as in the Metrics statement in the problem report by the supervisor, we are also asked to compare perclass classification.
